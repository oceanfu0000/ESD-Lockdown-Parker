**ESD Lockdown Parker** is a **microservices-based system** designed for event-driven communication using üì® **RabbitMQ** and **Composite Microservices**. It manages critical functionalities such as **access control**, **event logging**, **error handling**, **payments**, and **notifications** within a distributed architecture, ensuring seamless communication between services. *(Thanks, ChatGPT! ü§ñ)*


## üõ†Ô∏è **1. Prerequisites**

Before starting, make sure you have the following installed on your computer:

Make sure you have the `.env` **(root)**, `esdlocking.json` **(telegramservice)** , `credentials.json` and `token.json` **(emailservice)** file in your project folder!

**Missing token.json?**

Your token has expired/doesn't exist! Please do the following:
```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
cd emailservice
python3 emailservice.py
```
Afterwards, go to postman and run http://127.0.0.1:8088/email (POST)

### üîß **Step-by-Step Instructions:**


1. **Navigate to the root directory of the project**:
   ```
   cd ESD-Lockdown-Parker
   ```

2. **Run Docker Compose** to start the services:
   ```
   docker compose up --build -d
   ```
   > **Note**: Always include `--build` if you're making code changes to rebuild the containers.

   If you are having trouble running kong, run this commands
   ```
   docker-compose run --rm kong kong migrations up

   docker-compose run --rm kong kong migrations finish

   docker-compose up kong --build -d
   ```

## üñ•Ô∏è **3. Running the Frontend**

To access the frontend, go to http://localhost:8100/home.html



## üìå **4. Important Information**

For the list of ports, check out **Notes.md** for details about the different services running and their corresponding ports.

To view API documentation for the respective services, go to http://localhost:[port number]/apidocs

If there is no endpoint for the files (API), you can use pydocs to read the documentation. E.g.

```
python -m pydoc amqp_setup
```


## ‚ùå **5. Shutting Down**

Once you're done with testing, don't forget to shut down everything:
```
docker compose down
```
