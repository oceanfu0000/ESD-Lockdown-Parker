## To Run!

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine:

### 1. Set Up
Make sure you have **ngrok** installed. Then, install the necessary dependencies by running:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start ngrok, creating a public URL that forwards HTTP traffic to your local server running on port 8080. You will see output like this:

```
ngrok http 8080
```
Change WEBHOOK_URL to whatever your traffic is being forwarded to 
```
Forwarding https://abc123.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:8080
```
